    <p>In coordination with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Red Cross is seeking people who are fully recovered from the new coronavirus to sign up to donate plasma to help current COVID-19 patients.</p>
    
    <p>People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies in their plasma that can attack the virus. This convalescent plasma is being evaluated as treatment for patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections, or those judged by a healthcare provider to be at high risk of progression to severe or life-threatening disease.</p><br>
    
    <p>Requirements</p>
    <li> You are at least 17 years old and weigh 110 lbs. Additional weight requirements apply for donors age 18 or younger.</li>
    <li>In good health. You generally feel well, even if you're being treated for a chronic condition.</li>
    <li>Have a prior, verified diagnosis of COVID-19, but are now symptom free and fully recovered from COVID-19.</li><br>

    <p>Additionally, the Red Cross is testing all blood, platelet and plasma donations for COVID-19 antibodies. The Red Cross hopes testing will provide critical insight into whether donors may have possibly been exposed to this coronavirus, as some COVID-19 carriers can be asymptomatic.

    <p>While fabric masks are not to be used in the care of COVID-19 patients, according to the CDC, fabric masks are a crisis response option when other supplies have been exhausted. Fabric masks can also be helpful in other areas of patient care as supplies of PPE are depleted.</p><br>

    <p>While the current COVID-19 outbreak in NYC is dramatically impacting the lives of every person in our city, please remember that homeless New Yorkers are particularly vulnerable, as they have much higher rates of serious underlying health problems, generally lack access to quality health care, and have no way to self-quarantine. The Coalition for the Homeless is doing all in our power to ensure that our neighbors without homes get the help and protection they need during this crisis.</p><br>
   
    <p>People bedding down on the streets, in the subway, and in other public places are particularly vulnerable, as they have higher rates of serious health problems, are constantly exposed to the environment, and lack access to bathrooms and running water needed to simply wash their hands.</p><br>
   
    <p>The situation is becoming dire as soup kitchens and food pantries around the city suspend operations in response to the outbreak, dramatically increasing the number of people in need on the streets.</p><br>

<button class = "rwcf-button donate-button"> Restaurant Worker Community Foundation</button>

  <div> 
   
    <p>Restaurant Workers Community Foundation was founded in 2018 to advocate for gender equality, racial justice, fair wages, and healthy work environments in the restaurant industry. In the wake of the coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic, RWCF’s full focus is on supporting workers, small business owners, and an industry in crisis.</p><br>
    
    <p>Restaurant workers make up 10 percent of America’s workforce, and they are among the country's most vulnerable populations. More than 2.45 million restaurant workers live in poverty, and only 14 percent receive employer-sponsored health benefits.</p><br>
   
    <p>As restaurants across the country cut hours, suspend business, and close for good, many restaurant workers will be faced with long-term loss of income. For months to come, they will need help accessing government benefits and mental health services, paying their rent, and feeding their families.</p><br> 

    <p>RWCF has established a Restaurant Workers COVID19 Crisis Relief Fund to: </p><br>
    <li>Immediately direct money to organizations leading on-the-ground efforts in the restaurant community. </li>
    <li>To bolster our impact investing budget to provide zero-interest loans to businesses to maintain payroll during closure or re-open once this crisis has passed.</li>
    <li>To establish a relief fund for individual workers facing economic hardships or health crises as a direct result of COVID-19.</li><br>

    <p>We are sharing the love by donating our time and resources into making these mask clips to help reduce ear pain. With requirements to wear masks for 8-12 hrs, healthcare workers often will use a paperclip to hook in back so the straps are not putting pressure on their ears (which causes soreness, sores and pain). Gifted Hands Gift Shop is laser-cutting these multi-setting mask clips for FREE to our healthcare community looking for a little less strain in their day. Not only do the clips relieve pressure on the ears, but they also help to make the mask more snug, which aids in its effectiveness.</p><br>
