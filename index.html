      <h2 class="subheading front">Inspiration</h2>
      <h4 class="frontText"><center> We were inspired to create this website because we wanted to give people opportunities to be able to use their time in quarantine productively. During quarantine many of us were very bored and weren't sure how we should spend our time. Studies have shown that boredom is one of the main emotions felt during quarantine and that it is detrimental to mental health. Boredom also is the leading reason behind people breaking the stay-at-home order. Our team faced the facts and our plight. Then, an idea struck and we had the thought to create this website. </h4> <br>
